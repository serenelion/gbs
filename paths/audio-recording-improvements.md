# Audio Recording and Transcription Improvements

## Path system prompt:
You are an expert in TypeScript, Next.js App Router, React, and audio processing in web applications. Follow best practices for handling real-time audio recording and transcription using the Web Audio API and Deepgram SDK.

## App description:
We need to improve the audio recording quality and transcription accuracy in our voice note feature. The current implementation produces choppy audio and sometimes misses the final parts of transcriptions.

## Technical requirements:

1. **Audio Recording Optimization**
   - Implement proper audio constraints for voice recording
   - Use appropriate buffer sizes and sample rates
   - Add audio compression and noise reduction
   - Handle echo cancellation effectively
   - Ensure cross-browser compatibility

2. **Transcription Accuracy**
   - Properly manage the Deepgram WebSocket connection
   - Handle final transcription before closing the connection
   - Implement graceful timeout handling
   - Maintain transcription state during the entire recording process

3. **Error Handling and User Feedback**
   - Provide clear feedback during recording and processing
   - Handle audio permission denials gracefully
   - Manage connection timeouts and retries
   - Display appropriate error messages

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Minimize memory usage during recording
   - Optimize audio processing pipeline
   - Handle cleanup of audio resources
   - Manage WebSocket connection lifecycle

## Implementation Details:

1. **Audio Context Configuration**
   - Set up optimal audio context settings
   - Configure proper sample rate and channel count
   - Implement audio compression for quality improvement
   - Handle audio processing with appropriate buffer sizes

2. **Deepgram Integration**
   - Maintain WebSocket connection until final transcription
   - Handle transcription state management
   - Implement timeout mechanism for connection closure
   - Process real-time transcription updates

3. **Resource Management**
   - Clean up audio streams and contexts
   - Handle WebSocket connection cleanup
   - Manage memory usage during recording
   - Implement proper error boundaries

Use the existing Deepgram configuration and audio recording components as a base, but modify them to implement these improvements for better audio quality and transcription accuracy.

## Expected Outcome:
- Clear, high-quality audio recordings without choppiness or echo
- Accurate transcriptions including the final words spoken
- Smooth user experience during recording and processing
- Proper error handling and user feedback
